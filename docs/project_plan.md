## Project Description
This project visualizes fertility determinants in the Philippines using NDHS 2022 and previous historical datasets. It aims to create an interactive web application that allows users to explore demographic trends and statistical relationships.

### Features (Planned)
- Interactive visualizations of key fertility determinants
- Historical trend analysis
- Geographic comparisons (e.g. fertility rates per region)
- Statistical correlation explorer

### Technologies (Tentative)
- Backend: Python/Flask
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Data Processing: Pandas
- Visualization: D3.js
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
